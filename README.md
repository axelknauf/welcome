# Welcome

Hi there! This is the personal Github presence of [Axel Knauf](https://www.axelknauf.de).

Since I do not want Microsoft and OpenAI to train their AI models on my hobby projects' codebases (which are definitely not representative of production-quality code), I have removed all my repos and am hosting them now on my personal [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org/) instance elsewhere. If you've arrived here as part of recruitment research wanting to check my technical background: Well done! But let's have a face-2-face conversation instead!

Cheers,
Axel
